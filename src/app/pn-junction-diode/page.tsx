              A piece of n-type semiconductor or p-type semiconductor is like a resistor with a very high resistance. 
              However, when you join a piece of n-type and p-type semiconductor together, something interesting happens 
              at the junctionâ€”you get a PN junction diode.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The PN junction diode is one of the most fundamental components in electronics. Understanding how it works 
              is essential for grasping more complex semiconductor devices like transistors and integrated circuits.
            </p>

            <h2>Formation of the PN Junction</h2>
            
            <p>
              When p-type and n-type semiconductors are joined together, electrons from the n-side diffuse to the p-side, 
              and holes from the p-side diffuse to the n-side. This creates a region called the depletion zone where 
              there are no free charge carriers.
            </p>

            <p>
              The movement of charges creates an electric field across the junction, which opposes further diffusion. 
              This electric field creates a potential barrier that must be overcome for current to flow.
            </p>

            <h2>Forward Bias Operation</h2>
            
            <p>
              When the positive terminal of a battery is connected to the p-side and the negative terminal to the n-side, 
              the diode is said to be forward-biased:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>The external voltage opposes the internal electric field</li>
              <li>The depletion zone becomes narrower</li>
              <li>Current flows easily through the diode</li>
              <li>The diode acts like a closed switch</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Reverse Bias Operation</h2>
            
            <p>
              When the positive terminal is connected to the n-side and negative to the p-side, the diode is reverse-biased:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>The external voltage reinforces the internal electric field</li>
              <li>The depletion zone becomes wider</li>
              <li>Very little current flows (only leakage current)</li>
              <li>The diode acts like an open switch</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>

            <h3>Forward Voltage Drop</h3>
            <p>
              For silicon diodes, the forward voltage drop is approximately 0.7V. For germanium diodes, it's about 0.3V. 
              This voltage must be exceeded for significant current to flow.
            </p>

            <h3>Reverse Breakdown Voltage</h3>
            <p>
              If the reverse voltage exceeds a certain limit (breakdown voltage), the diode will conduct heavily in 
              the reverse direction. This can damage the diode unless it's designed for this operation (like Zener diodes).
            </p>
